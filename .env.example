# Development Notes
# ========================================
#
# 1. Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# 2. Never commit .env file to git repository
# 3. Keep secrets secure and never expose them in frontend code
# 4. For local development, use NODE_ENV=development
# 5. For production deployment, use NODE_ENV=production
#
# ========================================
# Setup Instructions
# ========================================
#
# LINE Setup:
# 1. Go to https://developers.line.biz/
# 2. Create new channel (Messaging API)
# 3. Create separate LIFF Apps for development and production
#    - Development LIFF App: Set endpoint URL to http://localhost:3000
#    - Production LIFF App: Set endpoint URL to your production domain
# 4. Copy Development LIFF ID to NEXT_PUBLIC_LIFF_ID_DEV
# 5. Copy Production LIFF ID to NEXT_PUBLIC_LIFF_ID_PROD
# 6. Generate Channel Access Token for LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN
#
# Note: Using environment-specific LIFF IDs allows you to test in development
#       without affecting production users. HTTP localhost is supported.
#
# Supabase Setup (Recommended Project: Line App):
# 1. Go to https://supabase.com/
# 2. Create new project or use existing "Line App" project
# 3. Copy Project URL to NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# 4. Get Project ID from URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[PROJECT_ID]
# 5. Copy anon key to NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# 6. Copy service_role key to SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
# 7. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) for members-only access
#
# Database Schema Setup:
# 1. Use Supabase MCP tools to create tables: members, products
# 2. Set up plant_shape field (‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÇ‡∏î‡∏á/‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á)
# 3. Set up is_available_in_store field for store vs market plants
# 4. Configure authentication guards for premium calculator access
#
# ========================================
# Security Notes
# ========================================
#
# Frontend-Exposed Variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix):
# - Safe to expose in browser context
# - Used for client-side LIFF and Supabase operations
#
# Secret Variables (server-side only):
# - LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN: Can send LINE messages
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: Full database access
# - Never expose these in frontend code
#
# Authentication & Access Control:
# - LINE LIFF provides authentication for members-only access
# - Supabase RLS policies enforce data access rules
# - Service role key bypasses RLS - use with caution
#
# Deployment Security:
# - Use different values for development/production
# - Regular rotation of secret keys recommended
# - Monitor access logs for suspicious activity
#
